## A few notes about the assignment

We would like you to model the product domain (it doesnâ€™t have to be perfect) and update the application to enable the two features.
Think through your solution and implement it based on the instructions and your own thoughts. Spend at most 3 hours on the assignment. It's not worth more of your time (or ours).

- Complete the assignment by passing all tests, having no pending tests
